## Credit-score-classification

In this repository, we create a multi-class credit score classifier. The dataset used for this project contained outliers, missing values, and bad data so a lot of cleaning and preprocessing was done to transform data into a machine learning friendly format.

An enembeling technique with four (4) estimators was used to create the final model. The model achieved an 86% test set f1-score with no hyper parameter tuning. The area under the curve for the multi-class model was 90% which is outstanding.

### Packages used for this project include:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Imblearn
